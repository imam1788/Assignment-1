      <p class="speech">“Bangladesh was born because of her people’s profound belief in liberalism, pluralism, secularism. Decades later, our ‘Generation Z’ is making us re-visit and re-imagine the very values that our people in Bangladesh stood for back in 1971. As our people also did in 1952, to defend our mother language, Bangla. We are committed to promoting and protecting the fundamental rights – for people to speak in freedom, to assemble without fear or inhibition, to vote whosoever they choose, to uphold the independence of the judiciary and freedom of the press, including in the cyber domain. “</p>
